One general applications very been successfully applied is the fault detection in industrial processes, the main reason is because the K Nearest Neighbors is very simple to understand, however works incredibly well.\n",
    "**Why did you choose this model to apply?:**: I my opinion the K-Nearest Neighbors as one of the possible models that really go well with this kind of data, because it, K-Nearest Neighbors does well generalizing data and membership (based on similarity) and if the evaluation shows close (or falls) into an existing group, the K-Nearest Neighbors can easily clarify it based on distance from other members of its class (I was wrong).\n",

Decision tree can be used for a lot of things, Earthquake and disaster planning, Structural planning and integration, Portfolio selection, Real options analysis, Job classification, Applicant evaluation and etc. Decision tree learning is a method commonly used in data mining and is a simple representation for classifying examples and can be \"learned\" by splitting the source set into subsets based on an attribute value test. \n",

If the use of support vector machines is not prohibitively high, it seems to be the best choice. The training data can be \"only\" used the infomation of initially and the end of each school year.

    "The SVM is very robust to very large number of variables and small samples and can learn both simple and highly complex classification models. The goal of the SVM is to train a model that assigns new unseen objects into a particular category. It achieves this by creating a linear partition of the feature space into two categories, formally defined by a separating hyperplane (figure 1 and 2) and will learn from data you give it on past students and whether they passed or failed, and this algorithms is trained by trying to find a linear separator between the positive test cases and the negative tests cases and the SVM try to maximize the margin width around this linear separator and the points close to the margin are the support vectors, with these vectors the SVM algorithm define the model. After the model is constructed, there is no need to store the remaining points and hence the model is small.\n",

    "However, much of the benefit of SVMs comes from the fact that they are not restricted to being linear classifiers(some cases, there may appear to be no linear separator). Utilising a technique known as the kernel trick they can become much more flexible by introducing various types of non-linear decision boundaries.\n",
